# Playwright + Cucumber BDD Project

This project demonstrates how to use Playwright with Cucumber for UI and API test automation in TypeScript.

## Getting Started

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run all tests: `npm test`

## Project Structure
- `features/` - Gherkin feature files
- `steps/` - Step definitions for Cucumber
- `playwright.config.ts` - Playwright configuration
- `reports/` - Test reports and failure logs

## Example Scenarios
- UI and API test flows using Cucumber.

## Scripts
- `npm test` - Run all Cucumber tests
- `npm run test:rerun` - Run only previously failed tests
- `npm run test:retry` - Run all tests and automatically retry failures
- `npm run test:failures` - Run only previously failed tests
- `npm run test:all` - Run all tests without retry
